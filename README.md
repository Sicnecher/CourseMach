Welcome to my main project. CourseMatch!🤩
In this project you will see the use of microservices with different methods for frontend and backend, such as Next, Angular and Nest.js.
Why would I build such a big project you ask?
Well to sharpen my code skills of course😂 (and to impress employers🤫)
So, let me explain the project for you.
Basically, you can tghink about Udemy.
But my own type nof Udemy.
Technically, it's two projects inside one. why?🧐
Well, once you start the project, you need to sign-up/in to your account.
Then you choose, your either a student or a teacher. (one can be both but not at the same time).
Once you choose, it's a completely different app.
For a student, the app is like social media, he can browse through different teachers, lectures, he can choose if he wants a face to face teacher, or would he rather learn from a recorded course, while chatting with different teachers.
Menawhile, for a teacher, the app is more like a tool or a service, he cannot browse through projects, the app is 100% meant to be its workbench, editing and creating courses, chatting with students and more...
This is the biggest project I've ever built, runs like a butter and looks absolutly beutifull.
I think you'll enjoy reading it.
And hey, if you want to collaborate, write me (especially if you're an employer)😉
